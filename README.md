Using machine and deep learning to classify brain X-ray images as either "Healthy" or "Tumor

This is a project for my college Deep and Machine Learning class which I need to use a model from both sides. I was able to comapre and see which worked better for my data set.

I got my data from Kaggle and the link is in code and is filled with images of brains including ones with cancer tumors and healthy brains.

RESULTS:

The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (97.83%) but relied on flattened image data, losing spatial details. Because this data is full of iumages, It was not the correct model. The CNN, with an accuracy of 97.39%, performed better by using spatial features in the images, making it the preferred model for this task. The displayed data with the compared images made the CNN the clear correct choice and was exaclty what this project needed. Being able to use both machine and deep learning was helpful in different areas but once again CNN showed the advantages of deep learning for image classification.

If you guys have any questions on the code let me know!
